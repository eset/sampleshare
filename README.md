The app is able of organizing malicious as well as clean samples and URLs. It also offers various statistics about every user, sample group and download traffic.

External users are open to create their accounts and download a subscription script after they get their clearance from an admin and are verified. After this, users are able to download their available sample files.
Admins can view and manage all samples, users and their permissions.
